						<h3>Datasets</h3>
						<hr class="half-rule"/>
						On this section we give an insight into each and every one of the datasets, explaining how they work and how they were created.</p>
						 
						<br><h4><b>KITTI Dataset</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;Probably the most well-known dataset in the fields of AD is the KITTI (Karlsruhe Institute
								 of Technology 2018). The KITTI dataset was captured with a Volkswagen station wagon
								 used in mobile robotics and AD research. The KITTI benchmark suite started in
								 2012 at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with the need to have a dataset to classify objects
								 on the streets.
								 This project has grown by increasingly adding more results with more sensors. The KITTI
								 benchmark started with the stereo, flow and odometry benchmarks and today it includes
								 standards for object tracking and more.
								 Just like ATLASCAR 2, the car used in the KITTI dataset is equipped with LIDAR
								 sensors and Point Grey Video Cameras. The dataset is used for automatic recognition and
								 tracking of vehicles and pedestrians.
								 It consists in image sequences and a text file in which, for each frame the
								 various objects in the field of view are depicted with and identification number, a label, and
								 coordinates about their position in the 2D and 3D space (Geiger et al. 2013).
								 The development kit used for the KITTI database contains C++ and MATLAB code to
								 read the sensor data and write dataset results. The data development kit used is provided
								 on the KITTI Website (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology 2018). It contains a MATLAB
								 demonstration code with C++ wrappers</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/Volkswaggen-KITTI.png"> <img src="./assets/images/KITTI-Deployment.png"> <img src="./assets/images/KITTI-Dataset.png"></p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/KITTI-Tracking.png"></p>
						<p>&emsp;The demonstration script of the KITTI development kit shows how 3D boxes can be read from the dataset files and projected into the image plane of the cameras.
								 The data is processed and inserted into MATLAB structures and arrays. The KITTI database also uses the PCL to process and gather the pointclouds obtained from the LIDAR sensors.
								 The data is stored in snippets like the example seen above, in which, each line starts with the frame ID and the ID of the object being tracked. Then it is added a label
								 to classify this object. There are also flags to indicate if the object is either truncated or occluded in the image sequence.
								 The following numbers consist in the alpha (observation angle of object), the left, top, right and bottom of the 2D bounding box, the height, width and length of the 3D bounding
								 box and its XYZ coordinates. The last number consists in the 3D rotation angle in the Y axis (Boston Didi Team 2018).
								 Analyzing the snippet, a cyclist and a pedestrian can be located in frame 3 and the same cyclist and pedestrian (because they have the same object id) in the next frame with also a
								 van. The DontCare label is often shown representing an object detected that is not related to the scope of the KITTI dataset. Other information indicate where these objects are found
								 relatively to the car.</p>

						<br><h4><b>Kafka Broker</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;This broker is a component that comunicates through a Restful API with other services and its main function is to be a message middleware that handles real-time data (Chess  moves from players) from Unity. It reads and writes data of the chess moves and it sends the data to the Glassfish Servlets and Dumper.</p>
	
						<br><h4><b>Game Tracker - CLI(Chess Layout Interface)</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;The purpose of this module is to display the chessboard with the chess-moves being made by the players in Unity. Basically in this module we have two consumers that are consuming data from the Kafka Broker and playing the game on the Game Tracker module according to the received data. This module will be used by the web interface in order to determine the game status as well as other additional information </p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/gametracker_CLI.png"> <img src="./assets/images/gametracker_CLI02.png"></p>
						
						<br><h4><b>WEB User Interface - REST API</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;The Chess Tourney Web Portal is the web interface between the Chess Tourney platform and any person that wants to see a game or tournament. This API uses a REST-ful engine with a set of endpoints(described below) to manage all the information, by collecting data from the GlassFish Servlets and/or Database and displaying it in the WEB API. It can show a specific game beetween two players, chess-moves, frequencies and other devolpments.</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/chess-web-api.png"></p>
						<p>As mentioned earlier the API uses a REST-ful engine with a set endpoints that collects data of the Game Tracker module from the Glassfish Servlets and displays it on the web Interface.</p><p>This REST-ful engine uses 7 endpoints, each with a specific purpose using the HTTP methods GET, POST and PUT:</p> 
						<br><h5><b> - POST GAME</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a POST to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to start new chess game" option it will create a brand new game, resetting the pieces back to their original starting positions resetting the board to its initial state</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/postgame.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - GET GAME</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game status" option it will return the chessboard state according to the GameTracker module</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/getgame.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - GET MOVES</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game moves" option it will return the current list of valid moves, given the placement of the pieces and whose turn it currently is</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/getmoves.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - POST MOVES</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a POST to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check on latest moves" option it will return the chessboard state according to the last move being made on the GameTracker module or it will return the chessboard state according to a specific move specified by the user on the URL</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/postmoves.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - PUT GAME</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a PUT to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check on latest game status" option it will return the chessboard state according to move id being set on the GameTracker module giving the chessboard status according to chess moves of each user</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/putgame1.png"> <img src="./assets/images/putgame2.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - GET PIECE FREQUENCY</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game moves" option it will return the current list of the pieces given their placement on the board as well as their play frequency according to the game status</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/piecesfreq.png"></p>
						<br><h5><b> - GET MOVES FREQUENCY</b></h5><br>
						<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check move frequency" option it will return the current list of valid moves as well as their frequency on the playlist, given the placement of the pieces and whose turn it currently is</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/movesfreq.png"></p>
	
											
						<br><h4><b>Dumper</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;The Chess Tourney Dumper is a JPA persistance module that store information from Broker. It saves all the information gathered by the system, including all the Chess Moves from player's games. Within a defined interval, this component will fetch data from the current streams and save it on Database.</p>
	
						<br><h4><b>GlassFish Servlets</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;GlassFish Servlets have the function to add the interactive web front end to the Chess Tourney, ensuring the portability and scalability of the application between broker and restAPI</p>
