					<h3>ATLAS Project</h3>
					<hr class="half-rule"/>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLAS project has vast experience with autonomous navigation in controlled environments, this is  especially shown in projects such as the ATLASCAR1 which was a full sized prototype equipped with several state of the art sensors(LARlabs 2018). Currently, the ATLAS project is now evolving to deal with real road scenarios with the ATLASCAR2 project which is the new full sized prototype being used for research purposes equipped with LIDAR sensors and a Point Grey Camera.</p>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLAS project was created in 2003 and it started with robot prototypes that were later developed to participate at AD competitions taking place at the Portuguese National Robotics Festival. From this project. three small-sized platform robots were built, which were very successfull having won some prizes in other robotics competitions.</p>
					<p>&emsp;As time goes on, the project grew evolving into full-sized prototypes: the ATLASCARs, ATLASCAR1 which is the first full-sized platform and it is based on a Ford Escort Station Wagon, and the ATLASCAR2 which is a full-sized platform and it is based on a Mitsubishi i-MiEV.</p>
					<!-- This section briefly describes the planned overall architecture of our solution. Our architecture is divided into 3 layers: <b>(1) Distributed data sources</b> (Data Generation Layer); <b>(2) IoT Platform</b> (Business Layer) and <b>(3) Applications</b> (Presentation Layer).</p>
					<p>&emsp;The distributed data sources layer sends the data gathered from the city to the IoT Platform, that stores and analyses all the data received. The IoT Platform also has the modules "AAA" and "IoT City Monitors and Alarms", that connect to the Application Layer to provide the user a fully functional and robust system. The application layer presents all the features to the user in a friendly way, with three custom applications, targeted for different users. --></p>
					<br>
					<div class="arch-div"><div class="h-caption" style="border-style: solid; border-color: grey;"><img src="./assets/images/atlas_prototypes.png" alt="The atlas prototype robots"><br><h6>Prototype robots of the ATLAS project for the 2003 Portuguese National Robotics Festival</h6></div></div>
					<br>
					<p>&emsp; The ATLASCAR is one of the projects developed from the ATLAS project, which is a project developed by the Group of Automation and Robotics at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Aveiro, Portugal. The focus of the ATLAS project was to develop and enable the proliferation of advanced sensing and active systems designed for implementation in automobiles and affine platforms. These advanced active systems keep on being improved, or newly developed, using the data acquired from vision, laser and other sensors.</p>
					<!-- <p>&emsp;On the <b>“Distributed data sources"</b> layer, we have a set of sensors for each type of data (lighting, waste, temperature,...). These sensors will collect data from the environment and send to an aggregator. The aggregators will send the information to a gateway, which will be the point of contact with the broker in the “IoT Platform”.</p>
					<p>&emsp;On the <b>“IoT Platform”</b>, the broker will receive the data from all the aggregators. The broker already exists in Altice Labs, and goes by the name of SmartIoT. SmartIoT is a platform that collects the data from the Altice Labs sensors that will be used in our project. The "AAA" module, where AAA stands for "Authentication, Authorization and Accounting" will be responsible for authenticate registered users. The "IoT City Monitors & Alarms" module will allow the user to add alerts to the data streams, with optional actuators defined. If any threshold is crossed, this module will notify the user and act accordingly. The module "IoT City Data Persistence" will store all the data from the IoT Platform. In some cases, it is also possible for the “IoT City Web App” to send information for the sensors (actuators). On that case, the information is sent to the SmartIoT broker, and then is sent to the sensor (actuator).</p><br>
					<p>&emsp;On the <b>“Applications”</b> layer we have the web portal, the administrator portal and the mobile application. The web portal is the interface for the city manager to see the current state of the city. The web portal uses the AAA module to authenticate its users, and receives the data from the IoT City Data Persistence. It also can add, change or delete alarms, notes and chage the state of user reports. The Administrator portal has the capability of adding sensors, streams, users, groups of users, and to do other changes on the IoT City Data Persistence Module. The IoT City Mobile Application requires no authentication, and it communicates with the IoT City Data Persistence to gather the values from sensors and create user reports.</p>  -->

					<h3>ATLASCAR</h3>
					<hr class="half-rule"/>
					<p> On this section we give an insight into each and every one of the ATLASCAR projects, explaining its main function and their external components.</p>
					 
					<div class="header-inside" id="spec-3-3">
						<br><h4><b>ATLASCAR1</b></h4><br>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR1.png"></p>
						<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR1 was equipped with several LIDAR sensors as well as several cameras. The data acquired about its enviornment was gathered by the scanners present in the car which would then process building perception into the car allowing it to move and perform task autonomously, like moving and executing maneuvers in small and controlled places. In the end, the ATLASCAR1 brought some very interesting and succesfull results which were then adapted to the new full-sized platform of the ATLAS project which is the ATLASCAR2, which was the vehicle used for research in this dissertation.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="header-inside" id="spec-3-4">
						<br><h4><b>ATLASCAR2</b></h4><br>
						<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR2 is equipped with various state of the art LIDAR sensors and Point Gray Camera, and it is also a full electric vehicle, unlike the ATLASCAR1, which means it is easier to modify, test and control unlike the previous version.</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2.png"><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2_1.png"></p>
						<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR2 is based in the platform of the 2015 Mitsubishi i-MiEV, a full electric vehicle. The battery that powers the engine is the same powering the camera and the sensors. The main characteristics of the car can be seen in the following table:</p>
						<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2_table.png"></p>
						<p>&emsp;The sensors and the camera used by the ATLASCAR2 can be seen down below.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="header-inside" id="spec-3-5">
					<br><h4><b>LIDAR Sensors</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;The sensors equipped in the ATLASCAR 2 are two SICK LMS151 LIDAR, a SICK LD-MRS LIDAR and a PointGrey Zebra 2 Camera. The sensors have been mounted in the
									 front of the car in an aluminum infrastructure designed by Correia 2017. These devices are connected to a network switch installed in the car to which a computer can be plugged to
									 receive the data from the sensors.</p>
							<div class="header-inside" id="spec-3-6">
								<br><h5><b>SICK LMS151</b></h5></br>
								<p>&emsp;The SICK LMS151 is a LIDAR sensor designed to be used outdoors. It is a planar infrared scanner with a large planar aperture angle often used in robotics and in AD
												fields for its high scanning frequency and operating range. This scanner is also able to scan distances through fog, glass and dust (multi-echo technology). 
												This scanner is provided with an Ethernet TCP/IP interface with high data transmission rate (SICK 2018b).</p>
								<p><img src="./assets/images/SICKLMS151_LIDAR.png"></p>
								<p>&emsp;The specifications of this sensor can be seen down below</p>

							</div>
							<div class="header-inside" id="spec-3-7">
								<br><h5><b>SICK LD-MRS</b></h5></br>
								<p>&emsp;The SICK LD-MRS is a LIDAR sensor also designed to be used in outdoors.It features 4 planar infrared scanners with 0.8 ◦ vertical aperture angle between each plan,
												offering tri-dimensional point clouds. It provides high scanning frequencies and long operating range up to 300 meters. 
												This scanner is also provided with an Ethernet TCP/IP interface with high data transmission rate (SICK 2018a).</p>

						<p>&emsp;The PointGrey Zebra 2 Camera is a high resolution camera with a Sony ICX274. It also features a GigE PoE Interface and it is highly configurable to fulfill any
											particular utilization needs (PointGrey 2018). The camera is inserted in a case made with 3D printing and designed by Correia 2017.</p>
