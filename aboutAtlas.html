					<h3>ATLAS Project</h3>
					<hr class="half-rule"/>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLAS project has vast experience with autonomous navigation in controlled environments, this is  especially shown in projects such as the ATLASCAR1 which was a full sized prototype equipped with several state of the art sensors(LARlabs 2018). Currently, the ATLAS project is now evolving to deal with real road scenarios with the ATLASCAR2 project which is the new full sized prototype being used for research purposes equipped with LIDAR sensors and a Point Grey Camera.</p>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLAS project was created in 2003 and it started with robot prototypes that were later developed to participate at AD competitions taking place at the Portuguese National Robotics Festival. From this project. three small-sized platform robots were built, which were very successfull having won some prizes in other robotics competitions.</p>
					<p>&emsp;As time goes on, the project grew evolving into full-sized prototypes: the ATLASCARs, ATLASCAR1 which is the first full-sized platform and it is based on a Ford Escort Station Wagon, and the ATLASCAR2 which is a full-sized platform and it is based on a Mitsubishi i-MiEV.</p>
					<!-- This section briefly describes the planned overall architecture of our solution. Our architecture is divided into 3 layers: <b>(1) Distributed data sources</b> (Data Generation Layer); <b>(2) IoT Platform</b> (Business Layer) and <b>(3) Applications</b> (Presentation Layer).</p>
					<p>&emsp;The distributed data sources layer sends the data gathered from the city to the IoT Platform, that stores and analyses all the data received. The IoT Platform also has the modules "AAA" and "IoT City Monitors and Alarms", that connect to the Application Layer to provide the user a fully functional and robust system. The application layer presents all the features to the user in a friendly way, with three custom applications, targeted for different users. --></p>
					<br>
					<div class="arch-div"><div class="h-caption" style="border-style: solid; border-color: grey;"><img src="./assets/images/atlas_prototypes.png" alt="The atlas prototype robots"><br><h6>Prototype robots of the ATLAS project for the 2003 Portuguese National Robotics Festival</h6></div></div>
					<br>
					<p>&emsp; The ATLASCAR is one of the projects developed from the ATLAS project, which is a project developed by the Group of Automation and Robotics at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Aveiro, Portugal. The focus of the ATLAS project was to develop and enable the proliferation of advanced sensing and active systems designed for implementation in automobiles and affine platforms. These advanced active systems keep on being improved, or newly developed, using the data acquired from vision, laser and other sensors.</p>
					<!-- <p>&emsp;On the <b>“Distributed data sources"</b> layer, we have a set of sensors for each type of data (lighting, waste, temperature,...). These sensors will collect data from the environment and send to an aggregator. The aggregators will send the information to a gateway, which will be the point of contact with the broker in the “IoT Platform”.</p>
					<p>&emsp;On the <b>“IoT Platform”</b>, the broker will receive the data from all the aggregators. The broker already exists in Altice Labs, and goes by the name of SmartIoT. SmartIoT is a platform that collects the data from the Altice Labs sensors that will be used in our project. The "AAA" module, where AAA stands for "Authentication, Authorization and Accounting" will be responsible for authenticate registered users. The "IoT City Monitors & Alarms" module will allow the user to add alerts to the data streams, with optional actuators defined. If any threshold is crossed, this module will notify the user and act accordingly. The module "IoT City Data Persistence" will store all the data from the IoT Platform. In some cases, it is also possible for the “IoT City Web App” to send information for the sensors (actuators). On that case, the information is sent to the SmartIoT broker, and then is sent to the sensor (actuator).</p><br>
					<p>&emsp;On the <b>“Applications”</b> layer we have the web portal, the administrator portal and the mobile application. The web portal is the interface for the city manager to see the current state of the city. The web portal uses the AAA module to authenticate its users, and receives the data from the IoT City Data Persistence. It also can add, change or delete alarms, notes and chage the state of user reports. The Administrator portal has the capability of adding sensors, streams, users, groups of users, and to do other changes on the IoT City Data Persistence Module. The IoT City Mobile Application requires no authentication, and it communicates with the IoT City Data Persistence to gather the values from sensors and create user reports.</p>  -->

					<h3>ATLASCAR</h3>
					<hr class="half-rule"/>
					<p> On this section we give an insight into each and every one of the ATLASCAR projects, explaining its main function and their external components.</p>
					 
					<br><h4><b>ATLASCAR1</b></h4><br>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR1.png"></p>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR1 was equipped with several LIDAR sensors as well as several cameras. The data acquired about its enviornment was gathered by the scanners present in the car which would then process building perception into the car allowing it to move and perform task autonomously, like moving and executing maneuvers in small and controlled places. In the end, the ATLASCAR1 brought some very interesting and succesfull results which were then adapted to the new full-sized platform of the ATLAS project which is the ATLASCAR2, which was the vehicle used for research in this dissertation.</p>


					<br><h4><b>ATLASCAR2</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR2 is equipped with various state of the art LIDAR sensors and Point Gray Camera, and it is also a full electric vehicle, unlike the ATLASCAR1, which means it is easier to modify, test and control unlike the previous version.</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2.png"><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2_1.png"></p>
					<p>&emsp;The ATLASCAR2 is based in the platform of the 2015 Mitsubishi i-MiEV, a full electric vehicle. The battery that powers the engine is the same powering the camera and the sensors. The main characteristics of the car can be seen in the following table:</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/ATLASCAR2_table.png"></p>
					<p>&emsp;The sensors and the camera used by the ATLASCAR2 can be seen down below.</p>


					<br><h4><b>LIDAR Sensors</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;The sensors equipped in the ATLASCAR 2 are two SICK LMS151 LIDAR, a SICK LD-MRS LIDAR and a PointGrey Zebra 2 Camera. The sensors have been mounted in the
									 front of the car in an aluminum infrastructure designed by Correia 2017. These devices are connected to a network switch installed in the car to which a computer can be plugged to
									 receive the data from the sensors.</p>
							<h5><b>SICK LMS151</b></h5>
							<p>&emsp;The SICK LMS151 is a LIDAR sensor designed to be used outdoors. It is a planar infrared scanner with a large planar aperture angle often used in robotics and in AD
											 fields for its high scanning frequency and operating range. This scanner is also able to scan
											 distances through fog, glass and dust (multi-echo technology). This scanner is provided with
											 an Ethernet TCP/IP interface with high data transmission rate (SICK 2018b).</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/gametracker_CLI.png"> <img src="./assets/images/gametracker_CLI02.png"></p>
					
					<br><h4><b>WEB User Interface - REST API</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;The Chess Tourney Web Portal is the web interface between the Chess Tourney platform and any person that wants to see a game or tournament. This API uses a REST-ful engine with a set of endpoints(described below) to manage all the information, by collecting data from the GlassFish Servlets and/or Database and displaying it in the WEB API. It can show a specific game beetween two players, chess-moves, frequencies and other devolpments.</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/chess-web-api.png"></p>
					<p>As mentioned earlier the API uses a REST-ful engine with a set endpoints that collects data of the Game Tracker module from the Glassfish Servlets and displays it on the web Interface.</p><p>This REST-ful engine uses 7 endpoints, each with a specific purpose using the HTTP methods GET, POST and PUT:</p> 
					<br><h5><b> - POST GAME</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a POST to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to start new chess game" option it will create a brand new game, resetting the pieces back to their original starting positions resetting the board to its initial state</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/postgame.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - GET GAME</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game status" option it will return the chessboard state according to the GameTracker module</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/getgame.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - GET MOVES</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game moves" option it will return the current list of valid moves, given the placement of the pieces and whose turn it currently is</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/getmoves.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - POST MOVES</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a POST to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check on latest moves" option it will return the chessboard state according to the last move being made on the GameTracker module or it will return the chessboard state according to a specific move specified by the user on the URL</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/postmoves.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - PUT GAME</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a PUT to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check on latest game status" option it will return the chessboard state according to move id being set on the GameTracker module giving the chessboard status according to chess moves of each user</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/putgame1.png"> <img src="./assets/images/putgame2.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - GET PIECE FREQUENCY</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to look at game moves" option it will return the current list of the pieces given their placement on the board as well as their play frequency according to the game status</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/piecesfreq.png"></p>
					<br><h5><b> - GET MOVES FREQUENCY</b></h5><br>
					<p>If the user issues a GET to this endpoint by clicking in the "Click here to check move frequency" option it will return the current list of valid moves as well as their frequency on the playlist, given the placement of the pieces and whose turn it currently is</p>
					<p><img src="./assets/images/movesfreq.png"></p>

										
					<br><h4><b>Dumper</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;The Chess Tourney Dumper is a JPA persistance module that store information from Broker. It saves all the information gathered by the system, including all the Chess Moves from player's games. Within a defined interval, this component will fetch data from the current streams and save it on Database.</p>

					<br><h4><b>GlassFish Servlets</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp;GlassFish Servlets have the function to add the interactive web front end to the Chess Tourney, ensuring the portability and scalability of the application between broker and restAPI</p>

					<br><h4><b>WEB User Interface - REST API</b></h4><br>
					<p>&emsp; The API provides a series of tests using MockitoJUnitRunner class to see if the api responds accordingly.</p>
					<p> Theses tests were divided into 5 different parts</p>
