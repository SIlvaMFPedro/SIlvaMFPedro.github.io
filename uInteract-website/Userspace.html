						<h3>In here you will find all the necessary information in order to put any of our demonstrations to use in your environment</h3>

						<h4>First of all, please take into account that most of the hardware involved in this project has some performance requirements and you should make sure your computer is powerful enough to run it smoothly</h4>
						<h5>The Framework</h5>
						<p>All of our demonstrations were implemented in the open source Engine "Unity 5", and the user is required to have it installed in the computer in order to run any of them. </p>
						
						<p>You can find the free download link in Unity's official website: <a href="www.unity3d.com">www.unity3d.com</a></p>
						
						<h5>Vertigo</h5>
						<p>Our Vertigo demonstration makes use of Kinect camera version 1 as source of information input of the user's position and movement and Oculus Rift DK2/HTC vive to display the gaming environment.</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/kinect.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/DK2.jpg" alt="" /> 

						<p>After you acquire the hardware you will have to install the Kinect's Software Development Kit (SDK) which can be found Microsoft's official website: <a href="www.developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect">www.developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect</a></p>

						<p>Make sure you install the Kinect camera on a leveled platform and at least 4 meters away from the area you will be interacting with it, with no obstacles in-between</p>

						<p>You will need two platforms that will be used to hold the "bridge" which the user will move across, so be sure that they are strong and can hold the user's weight, then install one 2 meters away from the Kinect camera, and the other one 2 meters away from the first one. Then set a bridge, which can be a wooden board,at least 2 meters long between the platforms and make sure it is sturdy enough to not break during the demonstration</p>

						<p><b>AND YOU ARE DONE!</b> Now you can simply open our "Vertigo" application and it will load in your computer ready to be used. Don't forget plug in the Oculus Rift in your computer before opening the application.</p>

						<h5>Avatar</h5>
						<p>The Avatar demonstration, similarly to the previous one, makes use of Kinect camera version 1 as source of information input of the user's position and movement, so just be sure to follow the same pattern in order to install it in your personal environment, without the carpentry requirements.</p>
						
						<p>Make sure you install the Kinect camera on a leveled platform and at least 4 meters away from the area you will be interacting with it, with no obstacles in-between</p>
						
						<p>The application you will be opening is the "Avatar" one. This only works with one user at a time, so during the demonstration make sure that only one person is present in front of the camera, otherwise it will stall and wait for the moment where it can detect only one user again. Make smooth waves, not too sudden so the camera can react reliably and provide the proper feedback on the monitor</p>

						<h5>Post under Investigation</h5>
						<p>This demonstration, makes use of Leap Motion sensor as source of information input of the user's hands and fingers positions and movement.</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Leapbox.png" alt="" />

						<p>Firstly you will need to install Leap motion's Orion version in order for your computer to detect it, which can be found on Leap's official website: <a href="www.developer.leapmotion.com/orion/#105">www.developer.leapmotion.com/orion/#105</a></p></p> 

						<p>Then, all you have to do is open the "Post under Investigation" application and play around with Leap. Enjoy a whole new level of immersiveness</p>
