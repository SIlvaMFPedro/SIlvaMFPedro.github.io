								<h4>Preparation for milestone presentation</h4>
								<br><br><br><br><br>

								<p> Next week we will make a presentation of all demo's current state regarding milestone 04 so this week we have been making preparations for it aswell as continuing resolving each demo. More detailed information can be navigated through below.</p>

								<h4>Vertigo</h4>

								<p>Vertigo's graphical part is nearly complete. We have continued designing and applying the graphic components of the demo to make it an visually enjoyable for the user, working through the exportation related problems and finnaly have been able to apply the work done externally to the engine of the demo itself. The results are interesting but we cannot show it to you fully yet as we feel it might pass the wrong idea about how it will look like in the near future.<br><br>
								On another note, we have acquired our famous wooden table that will serve the purpose of connecting the user with the demo by making sure he/she realizes her feet are not directly connected to the floor but to the wooden board that has the same length and width of the Game Object of the demo itself. I will leave below a video that we will use in the presentation so that you can see how it looks like currently.

								<h4>Avatar</h4>

								<p>This week, again (but not for much longer), we have continued configuration of the textures applied to the Avatar model to be manipulated according to the user's movements.
								<br><br>
								Also, the skeleton of the avatar itself has been remade which solved some of our earlier problems when it comes to movement, mainly translation and rotation of the model. However, the issues that we have decided to call, flying ironman, still persist and will still need further study to fully understand the root of the problem and making sure it disappears completely. We'll leave some images of the skeleton below for you to appreciate:

								<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

								<p>Expect some more news regarding this the following weeks.</p>

								<h4>Dust Under Investigation</h4>

								<p>Regarding the first module we have made tests with users external to the project but on a inner group scale in order to better realize its current state and what needs to be changed for a 3rd party user.
								<br><br>
								Work on the second module has continued and the scripts related to the interaction of the user with the testing tree are coming together.
								<br><br>
								On another note, we have adapted all the code and work done on the following module in order to make it possible to make our presentation with the Leap motion sensor by using our own swipes code and show to the community how it will work in an environment not related to the demo we have been working on since it can be applied to different themes and applications without much effort.

								<h4>Pong</h4>

								<p>This week we selected points on an in-depth image date forwarded by the kinect sensor in order to estabily a threshold on when there are items on top of the table used for the Pong's demo. 
								</p>

								<h4>That is all for this week. Thanks for reading.</h4>
