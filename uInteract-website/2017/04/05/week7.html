								<h4>First tests with VR</h4>
								<p>Advancement of Vertigo into the "next stage"<br>
								Integration of gestures with interface in Dust Under Investigation</p>
								<br><br><br><br><br>

								<p>This week we made some advancements in the code of some of our demonstrations and decided it was time to make some tests when it comes to the integration of Virtual reality and Augmented reality components into their respective environments. We will look into this further below. The Avatar demo has received constant attention and was worked upon as well.</p>

								<h4>Vertigo</h4>

								<p>Despite having being postponed due to work effort being deviated into Avatar's demo, this week after some discussion and improvements to the physics related, we decided it was worth the time and effort to start running some tests with Oculus Rift in order to see how the avatar's movement was looking when seen from a first person perspective. Results acquired can be seen in the video below. While it was a satisfying result, it is nowhere near what we want the final product to look like so next week will be dedicated to fixing those issues and get a good grip of the behaviour of the demo. After this, there is only need to improve the outside world, more specifically, the graphics the user will be seeing and playing in, which we feel provides much more immersion than just some blocks and downgraded version of things.</p>

								<br><br>

								<h4>Avatar</h4>

								<p>This week there is not much to discuss about Avatar as most effort as been done in the "back-end" and we don't have much to show.
								<br><br>
								We have started implementing animations into the Avatar model, in order to replicate the user's movements in a robust way.
								<br><br>
								Also, configurations were made to the textures to be applied into the model and configurations to the link between textures and developed animations.
								</p>

								<h4>Dust Under Investigation</h4>

								<p>This demo saw some improvements being made to how the interface looked like when compared to previous versions and at its current stage feel much more usable and refreshing to look at than before. Having changed the green prototypish panels for actual photos and relevant text that informs the user as to what he is looking at we can now change the main focus not to what can be seen but to how we can interact with what we are seeing.</p>

								<p>Therefore we decided to integrate the Gestures code developed over the last few weeks into the interface itself, in order to see what adjustments needed to be made and how intuitive it felt to the user to interact with the buttons and panels. While we don't have any sort of media to show this week we will be doing so in the following week so stay sharp for it.</p>

								
								<!-- The result can be seen in the video below: 
								<p>-Insert video here-</p>

								<p>As we could see, the current integration of both parts is favourable enough that we can advance from the introduction part of the demo into the part where the users will interact with the interface based on their results of the physical experiment. Next week will be dedicated into implementing this part.</p> -->


								<h4>Pong</h4>

								<p>This week further study was made on how to select specific spatial points on the depth map extracted from the Kinect camera sensor and how to develop an application to calibrate the rendered environment in Unity to appear directly connected to the real playing environment the users will be interacting with.</p>

								<h4>We will keep working and if everything goes as expected, should have a video of an actual representation of the Avatar animations demo next week as well as media on Vertigo's new features so stay tuned for it. Thanks for reading!</h4>
