								<h4>Preparation for testing phase</h4>
								<p>New textures and graphical improvements</p>
								<br><br><br><br><br>

								<p> As we close up on our pre-determined dates for deployment we have begun preparations to started testing in-depth our demos in their most advanced state while continuing development upon the rest. More detailed information can be navigated through below.</p>

								<h4>Vertigo</h4>

								<p>There is still not much to show about Vertigo this week. We have continued designing and applying the graphic components of the demo to make it an visually enjoyable for the user and make it more beliavable from a virtual environment point of view. This however, had its own problems when it came to exporting models from BLENDER into UNITY, as seen before with the Avatar demo, which resulted in a delay from what we initially developed and we're still grasping how to completely implement these into our world, redoing the textures as we see fit.</p>

								<h4>Avatar</h4>

								<p>This week, as referenced before, we have continued creating textures that can be applied to the Avatar model which can in turn be properly manipulated according to the user's movements, in a way that feels smooth and responsive. While not in their final state, we believe we're closer than we've ever been and will keep iterating upon it to see it finnaly reach the way we want it to look like.
								<br><br>
								When it comes to movement, we have made some adjustments to the script that will highlight the muscles directly connected to the movement of the user's limbs, mainly recalibrations, while we have still not grasped what exactly is the problem described in the past week (flying ironman). While it obviously isn't in its final state we will keep studying the way its behaving currently and identify the actions in phases in order to better see what exactly is going on.
								</p>

								<!-- <a href="#" class="image left"><img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Avatar_week09.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->

								<p>Expect some news regarding this the following weeks.</p>

								<h4>Dust Under Investigation</h4>

								<p>Regarding the first module we have added an initial panel mainly aimed at presenting the user the application itself and the partners related with it (FCCV).
								<br><br>
								Work on the second module has started and discussion was made which resulted in a prototype image of how the testing tree will look like regarding the last phase of the experiment. Also, due to the movements and interaction related to this module, we started development of all code related with the manipulation of the tree pages in a way that will feel smooth and responsive to the hands of the users, namely clicks into the tree branches or swipes. Last but not least, the final panel which will present the results was created and code related to it was also iterated upon although we still need to make the connection between the two parts, which we will be working on the following week.

								<h4>Pong</h4>

								<p>This week we kept developing code related to the detection of objects by the Kinect sensor, using openCV (in comparison to the late PCL).

								<h4>That is all for this week. Thanks for reading.</h4>
