								<h4>Current state and next steps</h4>
								<p>Connecting textures to the model in Avatar<br>
								Pong's status</p>
								<br><br><br><br><br>

								<p> As we get closer to some of our deployment dates we have started applying the final touches to some of the demos while continuing working upon the rest. Also there are some news about Pong's state that will be discussion in the appropriate section.</p>

								<h4>Vertigo</h4>

								<p>There is not much to be said about Vertigo this week. We have continued designing and applying the graphic components of the demo to make it an visually enjoyable for the user and make it more beliavable from a virtual environment point of view.</p>

								<h4>Avatar</h4>

								<p>As described last week, there are some issues related to the movement of the Avatar that we have yet to find the solution. Still, we have not discarded iteration upon the model and so have decided to apply the custom textures into it. Due to the way Unity handles textures, the developed materials in Blender couldn't be applied totally to the model as the resulting connection was not graphically plausible to how we want it to appear. Therefore we have decided to do some remodelation to the skeleton of the Avatar's model in order to get a better link between the model and its custom materials.
								<br><br>
								When it comes to movement, we have made adjustments to the script that will highlight the muscles directly connected to the movement of the user's limbs. While it still needs further adjustments, we feel we are getting closer to the final product we have in mind.
								</p>

								<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Avatar_week09.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>Further study will be done concerning this issue and we hope to have better news for you next week.</p>

								<h4>Dust Under Investigation</h4>

								<p>Having made the separation of the demo in two modules, as described last week, this one has been specially used to finish the first module, and we feel proud to say it is nearly complete as you will be able to see in the video below. Some adjustements to the gestures need to be made to make it feel more robust but when it comes to functionality its exactly where we want it for a testing iteration. 
								<br><br>
								Apart from being the simplest module of the two, it is also the most crucial technically since most of our interaction script using the Leap motion sensor is tested in this part and still keeps being so, to make it the most robust experience we are able to deliver. It is also important to note that this module has a high significancy that can go unnoticed, since it can be later adapted to a general interactive multimedia interface in a vast range of applications.
								<br><br>
								A new section was introduced in this module, designated as "tests", that will make it possible to see the results from the experience, after interaction with the tree related to the second module. Some adjustments were also made to the interface itself to make it simpler to interact with the buttons, if the user doesnt feel like using swipe gestures.
								<br><br>
								With all this in mind we started asking people unrelated with the project to try out the first module and gives us feedback that we could work with to make further improvements. Next week we will be most likely working upon the second module to see it reach its complete state aswell.
								</p>

								<h4>Pong</h4>

								<p>Across the last few weeks,due to constraints based with knowledge about how calculations based upon depth maps detected by the Kinect Sensor work, we have seen a postpone of development in this demo over the course of the project development and much discussion has been made about its current state and if it should be discarded. 
								<br><br>
								Even though time is not on our side, we feel that this demo would be really interesting to present to our users and show the public how components of Augmented Reality can be worked with to make an enjoyable application where the user can use their own body and limbs to interact with technology.
								<br><br>
								As such, while we have not yet discarded the demo itself, we are making a commitment to complete the remaining demos that are closer to their final states and then move the entire work effort into Pong in order to be able to deliver complete product that can be used, even though we agree it might not be the most robust we could be able to deliver. 
								</p>

								<h4>We hope to have some videos to show you next week with results from testing with real users so stay tuned! Thanks for reading.</h4>
