						<h3>In here you will find all the necessary information, from a developer's point of view, in order to put any of our demonstrations to use in your environment and hopefully helps us out with any problems</h3>

						<h5>General Architecture</h5>

						<p>The whole architecture involved in our project, involving each of our demonstrations, is the following:</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Arch_v2.jpg" alt="" />

						<p></p>
						<h5>The Framework</h5>
						<p>As referenceed before, all the work done during this project was in open source engine Unity 5 and we recommend usage of it in order to start working in way that can be free of any problems related to portage of the data.

						<p>You can find the free download link in Unity's official website: <a href="https://unity3d.com">unity3d.com</a></p>

						<p>All specific assets that we may have used will be referenced in each demonstration's section in detail.</p>
						

						<h5>Vertigo</h5>

						<p>Our Vertigo's demonstration makes use of Kinect camera version 1 as source of information input of the user's position and movement and Oculus Rift DK2/HTC vive to display the gaming environment.</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/kinect.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/DK2.jpg" alt="" />

						<p>Therefore, in order to tinker with the code, you will have to install the Kinect's Software Development Kit (SDK) which can be found Microsoft's official website: <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect">developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect</a></p>

						<p>This demonstrations architecture can be described by the following image:</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Vertigo_Arch.jpg" alt="" />

						<h5>Avatar</h5>
						<p>Our Avatar's demonstration makes use of Kinect camera version 1 as source of information input of the user's position and movement and Oculus Rift DK2/HTC vive to display the gaming environment.</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/kinect.jpg" alt="" /> 

						<p>Therefore, in order to tinker with the code, you will have to install the Kinect's Software Development Kit (SDK) which can be found Microsoft's official website: <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect">developer.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/kinect</a></p>

						<h5>Post under Investigation</h5>
						<p>This demonstration, makes use of Leap Motion sensor as source of information input of the user's hands and fingers positions and movement.</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Leapbox.png" alt="" />

						<p>Firstly you will need to install Leap motion's Orion version in order for your computer to detect it, which can be found on Leap's official website: <a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/orion">developer.leapmotion.com/orion</a></p></p>

						<p>Then you will need to install Leap motion's Software Development Kit (SDK) in order to tinker with its code, which can be found on Leap's official website aswell: <a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/">developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/</a></p></p> 

						<p>This demonstrations architecture can be described by the following image:</p>
						<img src="/~pei2016-2017_g8//assets/images/Leap_Arch.jpg" alt="" />

						<p>The bulk of the work done has been to work on top of Leap's core assets already inserted into UNITY and available at the engine's asset store. The ones in question are the following:</p>

						<p><b>Leap's Unity core assets (<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/unity#100">developer.leapmotion.com/unity#100</a>): </b> These are related to the caption of hands and fingers positioning abode the Leap's Field of View and are a must to work with the hardware in Unity.</p>>

						<p><b>Leap's UI Module (available at the same previous download link):</b> This module contains some functions to design canvas in a 3D environment and recognize basic interactions between the user's hands and the UI, like clicking and dragging. This module is NOT a must but we decided to work on top of it, since it presents some easily adapted features to use in our interface design</p>

						<p>Lastly, Leap Motion's new version "Orion", saw the discontinuing of gesture based implementations, due to them being considered as not working the way they were originally designed for. Therefore, we have since coded some gesture based scripts that mainly reflect "Swipes" and "Grab" movements. We will soon make this script available in this same section, when we feel those movements are properly optimized for the effect we want them to have in the final solution.</p>

						<p>A main prototype of the interface is being worked upon by our team and as soon as it is discussed with the client, will be provided in here for you to have a taste of what the final product we want it to look like.</p>
